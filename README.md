# batik-image-classification-efficientnet
Built an image classification pipeline using EfficientNetB0 with transfer learning on a 600-image multi-class dataset. Applied Stratified 5-Fold Cross Validation, data augmentation, and fine-tuning to improve generalization. Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
